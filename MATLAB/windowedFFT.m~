function [P,F,T] = windowedFFT(data_in,Fs,T_resolution,overlap,type_window)
%windowedFFT This function computes a FFT with a moving window, similarly
%to what is used in the function pspectrum.
%   Inputs:
%   data_in is the data on which the FFT is performed
%   Fs the sample rate [Hz]
%   T_resolution the time resolution [s]
%   overlap the amount of overlap between windows [%]
%   type_window is a string saying the type of windowing function used 
%
%   Outputs:
%   P is the FFT output value [linear scale]
%   F is the frequency vector 
%   T is the time vector

%Width of FFT window [samples]
w = round(T_resolution./(Fs * ))
%Amount of samples the center index moves each window.
window_slide = round(w.*(1-overlap/100));
%Length of data [samples]
L_seq = length(data_in)
%index of middle sample for each of the windows
i = (0:(L_seq))*W + W/2;
i = w/2 + (0:N_windows).*window_slide;
